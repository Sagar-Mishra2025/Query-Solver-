Taragarh Fort, Bundi Overview
Constructed in the year 1354, the Taragarh Fort is one of the most impressive structures in Bundi. The state of Bundi was founded in this year by Rao Deva, and this was when the construction of this massive square began. Popularly known as the 'Star Fort', the attraction is located on a steep hill and offers a panoramic view of the entire city of Bundi situated in the Nagpahari of Aravalli ranges. The fort was described by the famous author Rudyard Kipling as "more the work of Goblins than of men". Sadly, time took its toll on this magnificent structure, and most of the majestic and fascinating architecture of the fort is now in ruins.

The entrance to the fort is marked by three gateways, followed by tunnels and many battlements along with ramparts. These exhibits are also of great interest to the tourists, such as the famous Grand Canyon or the 'Garbha Gunjan'. The Rani Mahal, which was built exclusively for the wives and concubines of the rulers of those times and is located in the same area, is also a great and famous attraction for tourists. The place is at its peak of beauty when the sun sets, and the entire city is immersed in the fading light of the setting sun.
